## Run 
1. `npm install` to install dependencies;  
1. `npm start` to start the server;
1. `npm test` to run tests;

## Documentation
While local server is started, proceed to [http://localhost:8080/api/apidoc]() to view the api documentations generated by [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com/);  

## Issues
1. `apidoc` sample tests does not handle json requests well, so invalid data is sent to backend, which `body-parser` cannot parse.
